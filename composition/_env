# Vault
# Variable name             Value
# VAULT_TOKEN               The Vault authentication token. If not specified,
#                           the token located in $HOME/.vault-token will be
#                           used if it exists.
#
# VAULT_ADDR                The address of the Vault server expressed as a URL
#                           and port, for example: http://127.0.0.1:8200
#
# VAULT_CACERT              Path to a PEM-encoded CA cert file to use to verify
#                           the Vault server SSL certificate.
#
# VAULT_CAPATH              Path to a directory of PEM-encoded CA cert files to
#                           verify the Vault server SSL certificate. If
#                           VAULT_CACERT is specified, its value will take
#                           precedence.
#
# VAULT_CLIENT_CERT         Path to a PEM-encoded client certificate for TLS
#                           authentication to the Vault server.
#
# VAULT_CLIENT_KEY          Path to an unencrypted PEM-encoded private key
#                           matching the client certificate.
#
# VAULT_CLUSTER_ADDR        The address that should be used for other cluster
#                           members to connect to this node when in HA mode.
#
# VAULT_MAX_RETRIES         The maximum number of retries when a 5xx error code
#                           is encountered. Default is 2, for three total tries;
#                           set to 0 or less to disable retrying.
#
# VAULT_REDIRECT_ADDR       The address that should be used
#                           when clients are redirected to this node when in
#                           High Availability mode.
#
# VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY         If set, do not verify Vault's presented certificate
#                           before communicating with it. Setting this variable
#                           is not recommended except during testing.
#
# VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME     If set, use the given name as the SNI host when
#                           connecting via TLS.
